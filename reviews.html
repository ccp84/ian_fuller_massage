            <p class="box2">I highly recommend Ian Fuller. I messaged this morning and was seen a couple of hours later. After the consultation Ian got to work and found the problem to my pain. I am now able to walk without any pain and hope to start running again tomorrow. Lots of advise given also to prevent another injury. Thank you Ian <br><br> B. Whittaker </p>
            <p class="box2">I've used Ian for a leg pull and he was very professional and conscientious and really did take the tightness away. Worked on a lot of my knots. He really helped me. I will be using Ian again <br><br> C. White </p>
            <p class="box2">My legs feel so much looser after seeing Ian, I havent had shin splints or a sore calf muscle since. He was very professional and explained everything he was doing, highly recommended <br><br> S Morgan</p>
